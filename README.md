## Bots

### API

Any bot you write should extend `BaseBot`. The game will call its `play` function, and you should return either a `Clue`, `Discard` or `Play` object.

The signatures for these classes are at the top of `hanabi.py`

### Included Bots

Scores are average of seeds 0-99 and are out of 25.

- DumbBot (1.56): Always plays the first card.
- ClueBot (6.56): Plays clued cards and clues playable cards
- ClueBotImproved (12.36): Avoids giving clues that have already been given and selects between color & number based on which touches fewer additional card.
- ClueBotMk3 (12.01): Explores all possible clues to try and find the most optimal
- ClueBotAdvanced (16.30) : Explores all possible clues and identifies all valid clues, then gives a clue to the player with the least information.
- LookaheadBot (17.04) : Predicts if other players will play on their turn and gives clues based on how those plays will change the possible playable cards.

Cheating bots: These bots access their own hands.

- BasicCheatingBot (23.17): Look at its own cards. Play any playable cards. Clue unnecessarily. Discard the last card
- CheatingBot (24.95): Looks at its own cards, prioritizing safe discards
